**Keywords**: GitHub Website, Vue.js, GitHub API, TypeScript, Development Approach

**Context and Problem Statement:**

Develop a secure and user-friendly login system for the GitHub Website, ensuring authentication and authorization for accessing home, login, and repository pages. Implement efficient repository management functionalities, including creation, updates, deletion, and version control operations. Design a responsive and intuitive user interface, optimizing performance, scalability, and security for a seamless user experience.

**Considered Options:** 
Option 1: Vue.js with GitHub API integration and TypeScript implementation.

Option 2: Alternative frontend frameworks with GitHub API integration and JavaScript development.

Option 3: Custom frontend solution without GitHub API integration.

Option 4: Outsourcing the development to a third-party agency.

**Decision Outcome:**
Option 1:
The development approach for the GitHub Website will involve: Vue.js for front-end development: Utilizing Vue.js to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.                            GitHub API integration: Incorporating the GitHub API to enable seamless integration with GitHub's functionality.                                       
TypeScript implementation: Developing the website using TypeScript to enhance code maintainability, productivity, and error detection.
